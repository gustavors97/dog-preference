# DOG PREFERENCE

  We all **love** dogs, right?

  In that spirit, IO.Insure designed Dog Preference! 

  Dog Preference is a form created with **Vuetify** and **VueX** to discover which is your favorite dog breed and to find out if you already had a Shiba Inu and would like to receive news about Shiba Inu puppies. 

  After the process, you can still tell us how much you liked our form so we can know how to improve and see the image from a beautiful dog from your favorite breed!
